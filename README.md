# Tic-Tac-Toe-Using-C
This is a simple tic tac toe game using C. Hope you will like it.

Best recomendation is to use Code-Blocks for running this source code or .c file. 

Note::
If you are using Linux and will compile using terminal
1.Comment line no. 9 and line no. 170
  i.e one for stdlib.h & another for system("clear") of clear function.
  
It's the same method for the person using windows and who will use cmd for compiling and running.

If you will use TurboC/C++
Prefer commenting line no. 168 to line no. 175.
And uncomment line no.171 to line no. 181
